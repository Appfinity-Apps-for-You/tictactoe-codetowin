**"Tic Tac Toe: Code to Win"** is a frontend development learning project developed at [Appfinity](https://appfinity.pl). Drawing inspiration from the [React.dev](https://react.dev) tutorial we created the project combining power of [React](https://react.dev) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) as well as [MUI](https://mui.com) components. The SPA application development environment is set up using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), a robust frontend tool. The layout is designed to remain fully responsive, thanks to MUI breakpoints and a dynamic grid. The project also includes [AdSense](https://adsense.google.com/start/) ads and [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/) implementation.
